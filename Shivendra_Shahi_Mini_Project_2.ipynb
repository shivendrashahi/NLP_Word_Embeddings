As we've seen before, pretrained word embeddings can help us determine the semantic similarity between two sentences. However, when you're working with monolingual embeddings, you can only compute the similarity in meaning between two sentences in the same language. This is a downside. In applications like search engines or question answering systems, it's often practical if you can search documents or questions and answers in more than one language."

        "In our first experiment, we'd like to find out whether the embeddings of two duplicate questions are indeed more similar than the embeddings of non-duplicate sentences. To this goal, we compute two types of similarity. First we take a look at a simple baseline, which calculcates the similarity between two questions as the cosine between their tf-idf weighted token vectors. We expect in particular that the tf-idf token vectors of two English duplicate questions should display a higher cosine similarity than non-duplicate ones. Moreover, these tf-idf vectors may also tell us whether an English and a French question are duplicates, simply because duplicate questions in different languages often still share content words, such as proper nouns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Second, we calculate the similarities on the basis of the sentence embeddings obtained with Smooth Inverse Frequency. For the English question pairs, the original word embeddings should be perfectly comparable. For the English-French question pairs, the word embeddings have been projected into a shared multilingual space by the makers of the MUSE library. The resulting sentence embeddings should therefore also be more similar for duplicate questions."

Let's simulate this setup by selecting from our data the 380 French-English duplicate question pairs.

        "Our simple experiments show multilingual word embeddings can effectively model the semantic similarity between two sentences in different languages. This allows us to build cross-lingual search engines or question-answering applications. Still, multilingual embeddings can do more than that: they can also help us transfer a trained NLP model from one language to the other. That's the topic of our following  on Transfer Learning."

        "One of the most promising applications of multilingual word embeddings is cross-lingual transfer learning. Suppose you would like to train an NLP model in several languages, but you only have training data in one language. Collecting new training data for each of your target languages can be expensive, and translating every text you'd like to process is rather cumbersome. With cross-lingual word embeddings, however, you can transfer your model from one language to the other very efficiently."

        "Needless to say, transferring a model like this is not without its problems. After all, two different languages don't just have different vocabularies. They can also display variation in word order, etc. This can be problematic for models such as recurrent neural networks, but also for convolutional neural networks, which take the n-grams in a text as their input.\n",

        "When the two languages are reasonably close in linguistic terms, you should be able to get decent performance from transferred model. However, it's very likely a model that has been trained on data in the same language, will likely do better."
